MW-SNL

MW-SNL an adaptation of the MW C++ software, which implements a dynamic
master-worker style application that works robustly in the distributed,
opportunistic environments.

Overview.

MW is a set of C++ abstract base classes that hide the difficult
metacomputing issues that can arise in simple master-worker parallel
algorithms. The goal of MW is to hide the characteristics of the
underlying environment by abstracting and exposing a complete API to the
user. MW transparently handles the various system events of the underlying
resource manager thereby allowing the user to focus on the main algorithm
at hand. Based on a layered architecture, MW makes implementation highly
portable across different metacomputing environments. Also MW incorporates
a very elegant group management mechanism that allows users to group their
work into different classes. Using this mechanism, users have to merely
manipulate group memberships of tasks and workers. MW takes care of the
distribution of tasks to workers based on group memberships. 

MW-SNL extends the MW software framework to more systematically allow
for templatization of the C++ MW core.  Additionally, MW-SNL implements
a communication layer based on the MPI parallel communication API.

Installation.

No configuration or makefile facilities are provided with MW-SNL.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies

This code was compiled using makefiles from the SGOPT optimization
library. However, it should be easy to compile this on many different
platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Platforms.

This package is quite generic and thus it should compile on a wide range
of platforms.  Specifically, this code has been compiles on RedHat Linux,
and SOLARIS CC 5.2+ and g++ 3.x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions.

This release is version 1.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation.

No documentation is provided.  However, MW-SNL provides significantly
more source-code documentation than the original MW code.  Additionally,
comments have been added in a format that should be compatable with
doxygen.
